**01-node is based on the crash course at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32M1al-Y6Ag**

1. Created the project with a minimal hello world main file.
2. Added a node http server that returns Hello in response to requests.
3. Added configurable PORT of the server that was hardcoded to be 3000.
4. Instead of returning Hello the API now returns values from the req param.
5. Added conditional responses in the http server handler for minimal routing.
