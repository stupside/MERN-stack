**05-mern is based on the crash course EP1-4 at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0exw-9YJBo&list=PLTMNWTDdd5z_CtvbzG6r1f4hjnCaphPTV&index=1**

## MERN Stack Integration

As the project will be built on the MERN Stack, I made the choice to create the project as I'm watching this crash course to practice directly on it.

## Course Overview

This crash course covered the integration of all MERN stack components:
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing application data
- **Express.js**: Backend web framework
- **React**: Frontend user interface library
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for the backend

## Key Learning Points

- How to connect all four technologies in a cohesive application
- API design patterns for MERN applications
- Frontend-backend communication
- Authentication and authorization implementation
- State management across the full stack
- Project structure best practices for MERN applications

This module served as the culmination of all previous learning, bringing together Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js, and React into a complete web application.
