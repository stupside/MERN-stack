**05-mern is based on the crash course EP1-4 at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0exw-9YJBo&list=PLTMNWTDdd5z_CtvbzG6r1f4hjnCaphPTV&index=1**

## MERN Stack integration

Since the project is built on the MERN stack, I decided to develop the project while watching the crash course to practice the concepts directly.

## Course overview

This crash course covered how to integrate all MERN stack components:

- **MongoDB**: Database for storing application data
- **Express.js**: Backend web framework
- **React**: Frontend user interface library
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for the backend

## Key learning points

- Connecting the four technologies in a cohesive application
- API design patterns for MERN apps
- Frontend-backend communication
- Authentication and authorization
- State management across the full stack
- Project structure best practices for MERN applications

This module served as the culmination of the previous courses, bringing Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js, and React together into a complete web application.
